Huckle Buckle Beanbag also called Hide the Object or Hide the Key, is a childhood game that involves the hiding and seeking of an object.

The game has also been known as Hot Buttered Beans in the US since at least 1830 and as Hunt, the Thimble, Hide the Thimble or Hide the Handkerchief in both the US and the UK. William Wells Newell described a version called Thimble in Sight in his 1883 Games and Songs of American Children. The game is known in various European countries.
